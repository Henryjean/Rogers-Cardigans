# Rogers-Cardigans

MrRogers.R details the method for scrapping [neighborhoodarchive.com](neighborhoodarchive.com) to retreive the color of every sweater Rogers wore in episodes that aired from 1979 to 2001. Data collected by Tim Lybarger. 

[Exact data was pulled from wayback machine](https://web.archive.org/web/20110525014454/http://neighborhoodarchive.blogspot.com/2011/05/sweater-colors.html)


## Update 4/10/2020 

MrRogers1969_2001.R includes the code for visualizing the full dataset of cardigan colors (stored in cardigancolors.csv) dating from 1969 to 2001. 

Colors were collected manually from [each episode](http://www.neighborhoodarchive.com/mrn/episodes/) and should be considered to be (at best) approximate matches.
